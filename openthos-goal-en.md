## Small Goal
**Run&Play our home-brew desktop OS wihch can run android apps+linux apps=openthos**

## Big Goal 

###Why 
* The main difficulties of the Linux desktop system 
 - Performance and user experience are not satisfactory 
 - Lack of a good software ecosystem 
* Pressure from domestic processors to software development 
* The rise of Android, from the mobile platform to expand the field of business
* Mainstream software and hardware vendor closer to android

###openthos plan 
* base on ANDROID 5.x++ project
* On x86-64, based on the Android-x86 open project
* High performance 
* Desktop operation optimization 
* Supports multiple CPU architecture, transparent to software vendors 
* Security enhancement based on Chinese standards and algorithms 
* Reliable cloud services 
* Transfer control to user

###Thorough desktop operating system 
* Comprehensive optimization of the keyboard and mouse operation 
 - Right key、select、drag-drop 
 - CTRL-C X V 
* A true multi window manager 
* Notification center 
* Task manager
* File explorer 
* Peripheral support
 - As a controller, not a device

###High performance
* PC hardware performance is far beyond the mobile device 
 - Similar screen resolution 
 - No power dissipation and heat dissipation limits 
 - More powerful CPU and GPU 
* More fluid use experience than LINUX 
 - 60FPS drawing frame 
 - Low-latency 
 - Highly optimized application 


###Enhanced security 
* Fine-grained access control and application isolation: 权限伪装 
* Evolution of TCM
 - Sector by sector verification of System partition
 - Dynamic checking process 
 - Full Disk Encryption of data partition
* Application store and Application Digital Signature 
* Biological identification: Fingerprint, iris 
* Group management: software distribution, device policy, remote lock and data wiping

###Good software ecosystem 
* 1,500,000 Android native application
* Mature development environment，more than 400 thousand developers 
* Commercial application software is developing strongly 
* A complete built-in LINUX environment 
 - Shared kernel 
 - Lightweight native GUI
 - A complete application development environment 
* Coexistence with Windows 
 - File system data sharing

###Open and standard
* Fully supports the Chinese password standard 
 - Commercial cipher algorithm 
 - Trusted computing 
* Open 
 - openthos  means open-source 
 - All open source, with the exception of a small number of third party business code

###Unified user experience across the hardware architecture 
* Particularly suitable for a variety of 64 CPU architecture of China 
 - Loongson：64-bit MIPS 
 - 飞腾：64-bit ARM v8  
 - Intel/兆芯：64-bit x86-64 (developing)
 - 申威：64-bit Alpha 
 - 64-bit PowerPC 
* Software developers one match, the whole platform to run 
* A wide range of hardware device business drivers
 - WIFI/Bluetooth, 4G communication module, sensor, high DPI resolution...

###UEFI BOOTMANAGER 
* Derived from the open source rEFInd 
* Support Windows, Linux and OSX(!) 
* Primary image resolution，theme 
* Secureboot and chain of trust
* Provide toolbox：EFI Shell, PXE and so on 
* Setting of UEFI 
 - the default Boot options /EFI/openthos/refind_x64.efi, can be activated by pressing the hotkey(Prevent subsequent installation of windows covering the boot entry） 

###Cloud Services
* Automatic protection of User file * 
 - Integrated cloud services, real-time, multi-version of the cloud synchronization backup for the data directory
 - Synchronized with other PC (Linux Mac Windows), can be accessed on mobile devices and browsers
 - End to end encryption, protect data privacy *(The service side can not crack the user data） 
* Application store 
* OTA 
 - System Update 
 - Application update 

###Work with other equipment
* Smart Device 
 - Android Wear 
 - Sensors and controllers 
 - Rapid information processing
 - Desktop unlock and auto lock 
* Android phone 
 - Automatic data synchronization 
 - 屏幕互传

###Trusty 
* Complete transfer of control to the government and industry group users 
 - User data and cloud services 
 - Application approval 
 - OTA update approval 
 - Source trust plan *: a specific user can sign the relevant agreement to check all the source code 

###Summary

* Openthos is an attempt to solve the core problem of the domestic desktop operating system.
 - To achieve a modern, consistent user experience on all platforms
 - Simplify the development of domestic software, improve the efficiency of development 
 - Provide a perfect, easy to use software ecosystem
 - Highly secure and reliable
* Open
